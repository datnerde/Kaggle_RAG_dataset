You\u2019re in the right place.\nThis is the legendary Titanic ML competition \u2013 the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.\nIf you want to talk with other users about this competition, come join our Discord! We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here: https://discord.gg/kaggle\nThe competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\nRead on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you\u2019re ready to start competing, click on the \"Join Competition button to create an account and gain access to the competition data. Then check out Alexis Cook\u2019s Titanic Tutorial that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\nThe Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered \u201cunsinkable\u201d RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: \u201cwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?\u201d using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\nRecommended Tutorial\nWe highly recommend Alexis Cook\u2019s Titanic Tutorial that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and this starter notebook to get started.\nHow Kaggle\u2019s Competitions Work\nJoin the Competition\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\nGet to Work\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\nMake a Submission\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\nCheck the Leaderboard\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard.\nImprove Your Score\nCheck out the discussion forum to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\nKaggle Lingo Video\nYou may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out Dr. Rachael Tatman\u2019s video on Kaggle Lingo to get up to speed!\nWhat Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled train.csv and the other is titled test.csv.\nTrain.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the \u201cground truth\u201d.\nThe test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the \u201cground truth\u201d for each passenger. It\u2019s your job to predict these outcomes.\nUsing the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.\nCheck out the \u201cData\u201d tab to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you\u2019ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\nHow to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you\u2019re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\nClick on the \u201cSubmit Predictions\u201d button\nUpload a CSV file in the submission file format. You\u2019re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\nSubmission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\nPassengerId (sorted in any order)\nSurvived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\nGot it! I\u2019m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\nFor Competition Help: Titanic Discussion Forum\nKaggle doesn\u2019t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you\u2019ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\nA Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data & code.\nIn every competition, you\u2019ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It\u2019s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition\u2019s Notebooks here.\n\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640Ready to Compete? Join the Competition Here!",
        "Evaluation": "Evaluation\nlink\nkeyboard_arrow_up\nGoal\nIt is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.\nFor each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.\nMetric\nYour score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as accuracy.\nSubmission File Format\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\nPassengerId (sorted in any order)\nSurvived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\nPassengerId,Survived\n892,0\n893,1\n894,0\nEtc.\nYou can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the Data page.",

            "Description": "Dataset Description\nOverview\nThe data has been split into two groups:\ntraining set (train.csv)\ntest set (test.csv)\nThe training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the \u201cground truth\u201d) for each passenger. Your model will be based on \u201cfeatures\u201d like passengers\u2019 gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\nThe test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\nWe also include gender_submission.csv, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.\nData Dictionary\nVariable Definition Key\nsurvival Survival 0 = No, 1 = Yes\npclass Ticket class 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd\nsex Sex\nAge Age in years\nsibsp # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic\nparch # of parents / children aboard the Titanic\nticket Ticket number\nfare Passenger fare\ncabin Cabin number\nembarked Port of Embarkation C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton\nVariable Notes\npclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\n1st = Upper\n2nd = Middle\n3rd = Lower\n\nage: Age is fractional if less than 1.
